This project is to learn more about networking and how reverse proxies work, as well as a bit of how async 
works in Rust. It is *strongly* inspired by Jun Kurihara's project [rust-rpxy](https://github.com/junkurihara/rust-rpxy?tab=readme-ov-file#user-content-fn-1-f146398b72012b86ed1302f469e33a0e),
of which the name "apoxy" is a bad knockoff.
